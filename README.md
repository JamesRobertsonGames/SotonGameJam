# Southampton Game Jam - Beat Revolution

## Introduction 
Unity 5 Game for the Southampton Game Jam 2017. The theme was "Revolution" so a rhythm game was create where you are a DJ dial trying to catch the beats as they swarm towards you.

## Controls
Point mouse towards oncoming beats!

## Beat Generation
Implementation of a Python Library currently controls the beat map generation. It takes a MIDI file and then will output the milliseconds of each hit, and, it's amplitude. From there, this is taken into Unity to spawn the beats in the correct position.
